Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in diagnosing and treating various diseases, enabling precise anatomical structure modeling, image-based diagnosis, surgical planning, and guidance. Despite advancements in deep learning techniques, traditional neural networks often produce
overconfident predictions and struggle with ambiguities inherent in medical images. These limitations underscore the need for robust uncertainty estimation methods to enhance the reliability and interpretability of segmentation models.

Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offer a promising solution by incorporating uncertainty into the model through a probabilistic framework. By placing priors over network parameters and performing inference to obtain posterior distributions, BNNs enable the quantification of uncertainty. This estimation is crucial for identifying regions where the model is less confident, thereby improving the trustworthiness of segmentation results.

In this work, we develop nine distinct Bayesian ensemble methods, each employing different encoder-decoder architectures while adhering to the same Bayesian principles. The combination of strengths from non-Bayesian ensembles and Bayesian networks inspires these methods. We introduce Bayesian ensembles for medical image segmentation with uncertainty estimation, where 
multiple Bayesian networks are trained, and their predictions are aggregated to calculate the segmentation and capture the uncertainty. The proposed methods demonstrate improved uncertainty estimation and offer better or comparable performance across different segmentation tasks.

We conducted extensive experiments on three datasets: ISBI-EM neuronal structure segmentation, MoNuSeg (histopathological images for multi-organ nuclei segmentation), and Lung CT scans. Our enhanced uncertainty estimation strongly correlates with misclassified regions, ensuring that areas of high uncertainty align with potential errors. Consequently, this method provides 
a more reliable and interpretable solution for medical image segmentation, ultimately contributing to safer and more effective clinical decision-making.
